            Jigokudani Monkey Park gives visitors a unique opportunity to see Japanese Snow Monkeys bathing in natural hot-spring. Vistors can get there by taking Japanese bullet train (shinkansen) and then walking through the Jigokudani forests. Vistors are not allowed to go into the hot springs, but Jigokudani Monkey Park is located between the onsen towns of Shibu and Yudanaka, so you could potentially go bath in hot-spring afterward. If you are a visitors that find money cute or want to visit something unique in Japan, then the monkey park is the place for you to go!
